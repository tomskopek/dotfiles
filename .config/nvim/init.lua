-- TODO:
--
-- Must haves:
-- ----------
-- - Copilot
-- - Auto fix imports on command, or even better when I commit (is that possible to setup?)
-- - Go to definition not working for css (styles.xyz)
-- - Commenting out react components
--
-- Nice to haves:
-- -------------
-- - Open visually selected lines of code in github.com
-- - I feel like indentation is not great? Need to study this some more and understand what actually needs to be improved
-- - there's a bit of lag when lsp servers starting up?
-- - Update dotfiles readme for setting up a new laptop
-- - Multiple cursors
-- - Telescope nav search_history
--
-- Annoying things:
-- ----------------
-- - When I open toggleterm python or node, I can get into terminal "visual mode" sometimes (I'm not actually sure what it's called).
--     It's not exactly clear what fat fingers typo I did to get there and I can't find it now... But it's quite annoying, and
--     I don't know how to leave. I have to do :q and then exit vim session otherwise my python/node terminal is messed up
--        -> I figured it out! If you click away (to something outside of iterm2) and then click back in iterm2 with the python 
--            terminal open inside of nvim, this gets you into this mode. To exit this mode, press "i" (insert mode)
-- - When I open a folder in telescope, the project directory changes (:pwd shows the folder that I opened). This means I cannot
--     change find files using telescope anymore. I have to quit and reopen vim.
-- - When doing "get references for word under cursor", I dont really care about imports...
-- - auto-indent not working well in some python files. Eg: panel_task -> try adding a new line and then == to autoalign it
-- - sometimes I get into a funky state when quickfix or filetree is open, and I want to close current buffer. It's like the quickfix or filetree
--     "take over" the screen
-- - exiting telescope sucks. If I enter and type nothing, I'm in insert mode. I'd like to press esc to leave. I have to press ctrl+c or esc twice. 
--     But If I press esc once to go to normal mode, ctrl+c no longer exits.

-- Exit terminal mode in the builtin terminal with a shortcut that is a bit easier
-- for people to discover. Otherwise, you normally need to press <C-\><C-n>, which
-- is not what someone will guess without a bit more experience.
-- NOTE: This won't work in all terminal emulators/tmux/etc. Try your own mapping
-- or just use <C-\><C-n> to exit terminal mode
--
-- vim.keymap.set('t', '<Esc><Esc>', '<C-\\><C-n>', { desc = 'Exit terminal mode' })
